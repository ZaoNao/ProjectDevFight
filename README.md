## About the Game
Project DevFight is an RPG-Esque, Dissidia-like, Fighting Game.
The game is  mostly Classic RPG-esque (Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy and
Phantasy Star and such) but with some fighting game elements.
Where each Colaborator gets a chance to bring themselves as characters
for the game. As well as Up to two original creations. They are also
given a chance to bring new ideas to the project.

This game as the time of this writing (Aug4,15) might be released for ::
* PC (Win/Mac/Linux)
* ~~Mobile (And/iOS)~~

## The Game -- How it Works
~~Though as of current, this is just one big idea, there is no definite
version that will be completed as a game yet. Thus the project is open
new ideas.~~

Long story short ::

You make content (Character, Map, Texture, Song, etc) and we'll add it to the
game. The game is JRPG-esque, but it's also an open field fighting game.

More Detailed Info will be added regarding technical details.
