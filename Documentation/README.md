## Project DevFight Documentation

Project DevFight is a growing project, having at least one new member, or a person interested per day. (Start - August 5th) However, a lot of these people have no idea of how to join the team or add a submission. That's why this document exists, to let newcomers join the development.


## I wanna make a submission!!
We want you to make a submission too! However, in order to keep this organized, we need you to follow a few rules.

#####To add a new submission
* You need a github account.
  * Make a new [issue](https://github.com/lordsolrac/ProjectDevFight/issues/new)
  * It must have a tag in order for the  maintainers to know what it is

Any and all new submissions should be titled alike the following::

[SubmissionType] SubmissionName [SubmissionStatus] by YourNameHere

SubmissionType can be a; Character, Level, Asset, Idea.

SubmissionStatus refers to what you believe to be how complete the submission is; Concept, Pre-Alpha, Alpha, Beta, Update, and last; Complete.

The submissions can be written in either Markdown (Super easy markup) or raw text, either way, once the submission is added, it will be  passed over as Markdown (to keep it clean)

Approved Ideas and Game Features can be seen [here](./GameFeatures.md)

The Submission types do have rules as well.
* [This is how a character should be written](./CharacterSubmission.md)
* [These are some rules for the levels](./LevelSubmission.md)
* More to be documented

## Bugs, errors and such?!
The same way you would add a submission, you would report a problem. However, if it's to report a problem with a submission, please note, Github's issue system includes a comment section, so please report there.

[ProblemType] ProblemName by YourNameHere

Problem type can be; Game Bugs, Conflicts or anything similar.

Please describe the problem and if it's a game bug, include a logfile.
