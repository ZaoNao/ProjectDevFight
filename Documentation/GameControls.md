##Project DevFight Controls and Gameplay

The Controls are a bit of an unselected decision as of current.

There are few Kinds of Control Schemes Available; DualShock, Arcade Stick, PC, ~~Mobile and 3DS~~

#####DualShock - The Original Idea
With the DualShock and Xbox Controllers being compatible with PC, it would only be logical to have them as a controller option.

* Left Analog Stick :: Movement
* Right Analog Stick :: Camera Rotation
* Primary Buttons + L1 & R1:: Primary Action Buttons
* R2 :: Enable/Disable Rage Mode
* L2 :: Enable Secondary Buttons
  * The Original Concept had secondary Controls
  * The D-Pad/Arrow Keys Would serve as a bonus for certain combo Keys
* R3 :: Lock Camera (If possible)
* L3 :: Jump

#####Arcade Stick (Not Exactly Recomended)
As usual, Professional Casuals (As Addressed by Carlos E.O.) use a 8 button arcade stick. Considering that there are 6 main controls, it can be done, however it would lack camera movement, and Enabling/Disabling Rage Mode would also be rather bothersome. So, a person with an arcade stick would have to help us out on this one.

#####~~GLORIOUS~~ PC ~~Master Race~~
Considering that PC is the Development Platform. It only make sense that those without a controller, or prefer traditional PC gaming style; I (Carlos E.O.) came up with a control setup. However these can be and might be changed at any time (if so, we'll update this file.)

* W-A-S-D Keys  :: Movement
* Space :: Jump
* Mouse :: Camera RotationCtrl-Shift-lk
* M1,M2,M3 (Mouse Buttons) :: Primary Action ButtonsCtrl-Shift-lk
* Tab :: Enable/Disable Rage Mode
* Shift :: Walk (Since the player might be running for the most part)
* Backspace :: Lock Camera
* Control :: Secondary Buttons


**** Things Not discussed After Here (Aug7) ****
##Gameplay - The Standards

A topic that was not discussed on a reunion, yet as pretty much expected was the gameplay mechanics. Though [there's a list of comfirmed features](./GameFeatures.md), the main gameplay itself is not listed there.

The main gameplay style is similar to [Dissidia Final Fantasy](https://youtu.be/WEBBb_YboiY?t=15s). Except where Dissidia Focuses on Fighting as that's most of the game, in story mode, The game focuses on level exploration, finiding new characters, and follow the plot. ~~(Maybe some sidequests)~~ While Multiplayer is focused on Fighting and using the level's many hidden suprises to your (the player) aid.
