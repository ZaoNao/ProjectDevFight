##Project DevFight Controls

The Controls are a bit of an unselected decision as of current.

There are 3 Kinds of Control Schemes Available; DualShock, Arcade Stick and PC.


#####DualShock
With the DualShock and Xbox Controllers being compatible with PC, it would only be logical to have them as a controller option.

* Left Analog Stick :: Movement
* Right Analog Stick :: Camera Rotation
* Primary Buttons + L1 & R1:: Primary Action Buttons
* ??? :: Jump
* R2 :: Enable Rage Mode
* L2 :: Disable Rage Mode
* R3 :: Lock Camera (If possible)
* L3 :: Secondary Buttons
  * The Original Concept had secondary Controls
  * The D-Pad/Arrow Keys Would serve as a bonus for certain combo Keys

#####Arcade Stick (Not Exactly Recomended)
As usual, Professional Casuals (As Addressed by Carlos E.O.) use a 8 button arcade stick. Considering that there are 6 main controls, it can be done, however it would lack camera movement, and Enabling/Disabling Rage Mode would also be rather bothersome. So, a person with an arcade stick would have to help us out on this one.

#####~~GLORIOUS~~ PC ~~Master Race~~
Considering that PC is the Development Platform. It only make sense that those without a controller, or prefer traditional PC gaming style; I (Carlos E.O.) came up with a control setup. However these can be and might be changed at any time (if so, we'll update this file.)

* W-A-S-D Keys  :: Movement
* Space :: Jump
* Mouse :: Camera Rotation
* M1,M2,M3 (Mouse Buttons) :: Primary Action Buttons
* Tab :: Enable/Disable Rage Mode
* Shift :: Walk (Since the player might be running for the most part)
* Backspace :: Lock Camera
* Control :: Secondary Buttons
