## Adding New Characters

This documents covers the character submission.
Though you can upload as many as you need, there
is, however a limit of characters that you can actually
submit to the game itself. (aka, various concepts, only
two 'products') In the case of a new patch, you may update
these characters or add a new one.

We already have a list of [Characters here](../Character Entries/README.md)

# Character Rules
### IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERY CHARACTER HAS IT'S OWN COPYRIGHT

In order to keep the game balance, we ask all creators
to keep their characters "Non-Broken". As in, nothing
Over-Powered or similar. (That's what the [Rage Drive](./GameFeatures.md) is
for.)

A Character Import/Submission must have ::

* The Drawings to tell how the character looks
  * Preferably a T-Pose drawing as well, for modeling
  * If you already have a model, then it should be in DAE, OBJ or FBX Format otherwise  a zip/rar file will work just fine.
######File A (CharName Background)
* The Character Description (Check the Character Entries)
  * Name; Title
  * Drawings Link (Github's not good with managing images, so just add a link)(Ernest Suggests Dropbox)
    * Which project does the character comes from
  * Description if any (Should include physical Description)
  * Character story (Optional)
  * Introduction to the Game's Story
    * Connection with Other characters

######File B (CharName In-Game)
* The Character File (Check the Character Entries)
  * Name; Title     (Example; Carlos, The Linux Loving Indie)
  * Character Modes (Normal; EX Mode Title)
  * Weapons         (Example; Swords/Guns)
  * Song List       [PLACEHOLDER]
  * Move List       [Concept Format, to be updated]
    * Name [Button Combination]
    * Description + Range (Should explain what the attack is)
    * Damage Range
    * ~~Unlock Requirements~~
    * Requirements
    * Creator's Comments, if any

## Adding New Characters to the Project


To add a new character (IF you're not a maintainer) you need to make a [new issue](https://github.com/lordsolrac/ProjectDevFight/issues/new) and this is how you should write it (So copy and paste it over)

Title : [Character] CharacterName [Version/Status] by YourNameHere

Text : (Use * to make the pointers in Markdown)(You can update this over time, just have the basics)
* Name; Title
* Reference Image Link
* Description (Should include physical Description)
* Character Story (Optional)
* Character Modes
* Weapons (Weapon A + B)
* ~~Song List~~
* ~~Move List~~ (This should be last, but have it somewhere around, please keep in mind [we have a concept for the controls](./GameControls.md))

After being completed, or at least having a near-complition state, it should be in the list of Characters [here](../Character Entries/README.md)
