# Adding New Characters

This documents covers the character submission.
Though you can upload as many as you need, there
is, however a limit of characters that you can actually
submit to the game itself. (aka, various concepts, only
two 'products')

# Character Rules
### IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERY CHARACTER HAS IT'S OWN COPYRIGHT

In order to keep the game balance, we ask all creators
to keep their characters "Non-Broken". As in, nothing
Over-Powered or similar. (That's what the RageDrive is
for.)

A Character Import/Submission must have ::
######File A (CharName Background)
* The Drawings to tell how the character looks
  * Preferably a T-Pose drawing as well, for modeling

* The Character Description (Check the Character Entries)
  * Name; Title
  * Drawings Link (Github's not good with managing images, so just add a link)
    * Which project does the character comes from
  * Description if any (Should include physical Description)
  * Character story (Optional)
  * Introduction to the Game's Story
    * Connection with Other characters

######File B (CharName In-Game)
* The Character File (Check the Character Entries)
  * Name; Title     (Example; Carlos, The Linux Loving Indie)
  * Character Modes (Normal; EX Mode Title)
  * Weapons         (Example; Swords/Guns)
  * Song List       [PLACEHOLDER]
  * Move List       [Concept Format, to be updated]
    * Name [Button Combination]
    * Description + Range (Should explain what the attack is)
    * Damage Range
    * ~~Unlock Requirements~~
    * Requirements
    * Creator's Comments, if any

## Adding New Characters to the Project

This documents covers the character submission.
Though you can upload as many as you need, there
is, however a limit of chatacters that you can actually
submit to the game itself. (aka, various concepts, only
two 'products') IN THE CASE OF DLCs, if applicable,
you may release two more characters.

To add a new character (IF you're not a maintainer) you need to make a [new issue](https://github.com/lordsolrac/ProjectDevFight/issues/new) and this is how you should write it (So copy and paste it over)

Title : [Character] CharacterName [Version/Status] by YourNameHere

Text : (Use * to make the pointers)(You can update this over time, just have the basics)
* Name; Title
* Reference Image Link
* Description (Should include physical Description)
* Character Story (Optional)
* Character Modes
* Weapons (Weapon A + B)
* ~~Song List~~
* Move List (This should be last, but have it somewhere around)
