#Project DevFight Game Features

#####Discussed And Approved Ideas

* Rage Mode (Carlos E.O.)
  * By completing certain moves, or recieve damage or grab a bonus, the Rage meter will increase little by little. Rage Level can only go up to 5.
  * Rage Count can be decreased by certain skill as a cost (just like magic needs  MP)
  * Rage is "available" once a level is complete. Meaning, once the first gauge is filled, level 1 is "enabled"
    * Having a level available can increase stats temporarily by a bit
  * Rage Mode can be activated (Similar to Dissidia's EX Mode)
    * Stats will boost temporarily as if Rage Lv. was available
    * Finisher Moves are accessible now
    * Character can be altered (Be it textures or model modifications)
    * The Rage Mode will consume the Rage gauge and the level.


* Skill system (Eduardo Toro & Luis Sobrino)
  * Skills can only be "upgraded" by successfully doing X thing
    * Be it a combo, or a skill, you have to defeat the enemy you've done the combo/skill to, otherwise it won't count.
  * While leveling up skills, relative stats will increase
    * If a combo/skill does offensive damage, the relative attribute will slowly increase (STR/DMG)
    * If a skill such as healing is improved, so will the HP and VIT


* Story Mode One-Run (Jose Miguel Vazquez, Fernando Curras, Eduardo Toro)
 * Story is not exactly linear, however, you would unlock characters along the way
    * In case that the newly unlocked characters are not used, they would be locked temporarily and would require a way to recover them.
    * These character can level up skills just as discussed above, though they might need to be balanced.
      * This would give a bit of replay value as some of the characters COULD be switched to another character (like in SMvC3)
